# Spotify Analysis

The project was aimed at analysing the trends across different genres of music through the years and get a picture of how different these genres are from each other. It focused on 9 genres - pop, rap, indie, alternative, rock, jazz, lounge, edm and country. The primary goal is to present maximum information using visualizations in R.

I also built recommender system based on the top songs of 2022 from spotify wrapped.
